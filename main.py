"""
SwarmSync Agent Gateway
=======================
Single FastAPI service that exposes all Genesis agents under one deployment.

Each agent is accessible at:  POST /agents/{slug}/run
  Body: { "prompt": "...", "testContext": true }
  Response: { "response": "..." }

Conduit-heavy agents declare `job_mode: "async"`. Real `/run` requests for
those bundles return a queued `{job_id, poll_url}` payload immediately so
Render's request proxy is never held open while browser automation starts.

In testContext mode the gateway routes LLM calls through SwarmSync's routing
layer with a persona system prompt matching the agent. For real traffic, the
gateway can be extended to invoke the actual agent logic (x402 payment, Azure
AI, etc.).

GENESIS_LLM_MODEL defaults to `auto`, which is passed through to the SwarmSync
router so it can run complexity scoring and choose the appropriate model tier.

Environment variables:
  LLM_API_KEY         - required for testContext responses routed through SwarmSync
  PORT                - server port (default 8000)
