"""Judge rubrics for the Genesis LLM-as-judge harness, expressed as DATA.

A rubric here is a :class:`Rubric` object: a name, the dimension it scores, an
explicit integer scale where every level has a written meaning, a pass
threshold, the exact judge prompt template, and a CONCRETE failing example. A
rubric that cannot fail is not a rubric, so every rubric in :data:`RUBRICS`
carries a :class:`FailingExample` showing an output that earns the bottom of
the scale and why.

WHAT THESE RUBRICS CAN AND CANNOT MEASURE
-----------------------------------------
``mode: "live_test"`` (``testContext: true``) BYPASSES AgentRuntime and tool
dispatch entirely and routes straight to the persona LLM. It is the only
practical mode on Render's free tier. Every score produced from a ``live_test``
run therefore measures PERSONA AND REASONING QUALITY ONLY. It is never evidence
that any tool works. :func:`tool_evidence_disclaimer` returns the sentence that
must accompany any reported score, and :func:`assert_not_tool_evidence` raises
if a caller tries to label a ``live_test`` score as tool proof.

DETERMINISTIC BEFORE JUDGMENTAL
-------------------------------
Some verdicts are facts, not opinions, and the model must never be asked for
them (global rule 5):

* ``outputs["determinate"] is False`` -> SKIP every rubric. The call reached the
  wire and the result is unknown. That is not evidence the agent is bad.
* ``outputs["outcome"] != "success"`` -> the harness failed, not the agent.
  Recorded as ``error``, never as a rubric failure.
* Success and failure BOTH return HTTP 200. Tool-level failure is signalled
  INSIDE the embedded JSON string in the ``response`` field. An embedded
  ``{"ok": false, ...}`` is a FAILURE and is scored deterministically as one.
  Never judge on HTTP status.
* An empty response is a failure.

Only what survives those checks is sent to a judge.
