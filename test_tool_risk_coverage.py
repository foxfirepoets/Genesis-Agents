gating test.

Imports the live tool registry and asserts every registered name has an
explicit entry in TOOL_RISK_BY_NAME. A newly registered tool with no explicit
entry must fail this test rather than silently inherit RISK_ADMIN (which
would be safe but invisible) or any other default — Phase 1's whole point is
that every name is written by hand and reviewed, never inferred.
