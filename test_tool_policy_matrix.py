"""test_tool_policy_matrix.py — FINANCE-TOOL-CONTRACTS.md Section 7 Phase 3
gating test.

expected_policy_matrix.json is a checked-in fixture, generated once from a
reviewed check_tool_policy() run and committed alongside this test. Reviewing
its diff is how a human sees, in one screen, exactly which permissions a
commit changes (Section 7 Phase 3). This test does not regenerate the
fixture — it asserts live behavior still matches what was reviewed.
