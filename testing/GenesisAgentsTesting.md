# Genesis Agents Testing — Master Report
**Date:** 2026-05-23  
**Method:** 5 parallel test agents + 1 recon agent  
**Base URL:** `https://swarmsync-agents.onrender.com`  
**Auth:** `X-Agent-Api-Key` header required (GATEWAY_API_KEY)

---

## Executive Summary

Tested all 20 Genesis agents live against their Render endpoints. **14 are fully functional, 1 partially functional, 5 are not executing tasks.** All 20 endpoints are alive. No 404s. No slug-routing failures (discrepancies are handled by aliasing).

The 5 non-functional agents share a single root cause: **the ConduitBridge (Patchright browser) startup path exceeds Render's 30-second proxy timeout**, triggered by agents whose skill bundles include `conduit` in `tools_advertised`. One line of code in `main.py` unblocks 4 of the 5. The 5th (Finance) has a persona scope problem requiring a system prompt update.

The routing layer works. All live agents route through `https://api.swarmsync.ai/v1/chat/completions`. `GENESIS_LLM_MODEL=auto` is now the default so the gateway passes requests through SwarmSync complexity scoring instead of forcing a direct model request.

## Payload That Works (Standard)

```json
{
  "input": "You are being tested as a live independent Genesis agent. Confirm your identity, explain your capabilities, then complete the specific task.",
  "task": "[ROLE-SPECIFIC TASK]",
  "mode": "live_test",
  "require_artifact": true
}
```

Header required: `X-Agent-Api-Key: [GATEWAY_API_KEY]`  
Content-Type: `application/json`  
Timeout: Minimum 60s recommended (agents 08, 11, 12, 14, 19 exceed 40s)

Fallback (Shape 2): `{"message": "[TASK]"}` — worked for Agent 10 when Shape 1 timed out.

---

## Routing Architecture

### How agents call the LLM

All Genesis agent LLM calls route through:

```
POST https://api.swarmsync.ai/v1/chat/completions
Authorization: Bearer [LLM_API_KEY]
```

Confirmed by both code review (`agent_runtime.py`, `main.py`) and by live response metadata present in every successful agent response.

### Live routing metadata (Agent 15 — most complete example)

```json
{
  "swarmsync": {
    "routed_model": "openai/gpt-5-mini",
    "routing_reason": "direct_model_request",
    "complexity_score": -1,
    "estimated_cost": 0.002903,
    "latency_ms": 14163,
    "tier": "mid",
    "savings_vs_premium": 0.015019,
    "router_v2": {
      "quality_gate_mode": "shadow",
      "quality_gate_passed": true,
      "quality_gate_score": 1,
      "provider_health_status": "HEALTHY"
    }
  },
  "success_criteria_eval": { "ok": true, "failed": [] }
}
```

### Routing Gap: Smart Tier Selection Disabled

`GENESIS_LLM_MODEL=auto` is the gateway default. The SwarmSync router receives `model: "auto"` and can select economy/mid/premium tiers using task complexity.

Fix: Keep `GENESIS_LLM_MODEL=auto` in agents-gateway Render environment.

### Known Routing Bypass

Legacy persona path has a hardcoded Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite fallback via direct Google API (`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/...`). Triggered on 429 from SwarmSync router. Bypasses routing completely — no metadata, no cost tracking, no quality gate.

---

## Critical Finding: Why Agents 02-05 All Fail

```
genesis_builder_x402 slug
  -> agent_loader.py maps to genesis-builder bundle
  -> bundle has conduit, run_code, github_tool in tools_advertised
  -> AgentRuntime._init_tools() starts ConduitBridge (Patchright browser)
  -> Browser init on Render free tier: 35-50 seconds
  -> Render proxy timeout: 30 seconds
  -> TCP connection closed -> HTTP 000
```

The one-line fix in `apps/agents-gateway/main.py` line ~1339:

```python
# CURRENT — bypass only applies to genesis-meta:
if bundle_slug == "genesis-meta" and _prefer_sync_bundle_run(body):
    bundle = None

# FIX — apply to all agents when mode is live_test:
if _prefer_sync_bundle_run(body):
    bundle = None
```

After this change, agents 02-05 route via the fast persona LLM path (no browser, 15-40s), matching how agents 06-20 behave today.

## Per-Agent Results

### Agent 01 — Genesis Meta Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: ~20s | Exec: 5/5 | Route: 1/5

Full 3-phase 9-task orchestration plan delivered (Gantt-style with assigned agents, outputs, deadlines). Identity confirmed as orchestrator. Routing confirmed via code but metadata not surfaced in response (persona path). The `mode: "live_test"` bypass is hardcoded for this agent only.

### Agents 02-05 — Builder, Research, Deploy, QA ❌
HTTP: 000 (timeout) | Short probe: 200 | Exec: 0/5 | Route: 0/5

All four fail identically — ConduitBridge browser startup exceeds Render's proxy timeout. Endpoints are alive. One-line fix in main.py resolves all four.

| Agent | Tools causing timeout |
|-------|----------------------|
| 02 Builder | conduit, run_code, github_tool |
| 03 Research | conduit, web_search, web_fetch |
| 04 Deploy | conduit, vercel_deploy, netlify_deploy, run_code |
| 05 QA | conduit, run_code, screenshot_url |

### Agent 06 — Genesis Content Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 17.8s | Cost: $0.00231 | Tokens: 1,863

Complete homepage copy: headline, subheadline, 3 feature bullets, CTA. Issue: self-identified as "ChatGPT" (persona identity leak).

### Agent 07 — Genesis Email Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 27.2s | Cost: $0.003829 | Tokens: 2,814

Complete 3-email onboarding sequence with subject A/B variants, personalization tokens, CAN-SPAM footers, cadence notes. Quality gate false positive on `{{token}}` syntax (shadow mode, non-blocking).

### Agent 08 — Genesis Commerce Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 39.7s | Cost: $0.007524 | Tokens: 5,585

8-step checkout/escrow flow with x402 authorization, escrow hold, ACCEPT/PARTIAL/REJECT verification paths, payout release, dispute resolution, ASCII flow diagram. Highest token count; slowest functional agent.

### Agent 09 — Genesis Support Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 20.6s | Cost: $0.003284 | Tokens: 2,537

Professional support email + 5 troubleshooting steps + 3-tier escalation path (L1: 2hr SLA → L2: 4hr/72hr RCA → L3: 72hr) + evidence request checklist.

### Agent 10 — Genesis Finance Agent ❌
HTTP: 200 (shape 2) | Time: 19.8s | Cost: $0.002362 | Exec: 1/5

Endpoint live, routing works, task deflected. Agent returned an action menu (payroll run, invoice processing, bank sync) instead of a revenue model. Finance persona is constrained to transactional operations only — analytical tasks are out of scope.

### Agent 11 — Genesis Security Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 52.2s | Cost: $0.003208 | Tokens: 2,546

Full OWASP-mapped audit: CRITICAL (brute-force), HIGH (account enumeration, SQL injection, weak password storage), MEDIUM (JWT scoping, CORS), LOW (verbose errors). Each finding includes test procedure and remediation.

### Agent 12 — Genesis Billing Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 41.5s | Cost: $0.003104 | Tokens: 4,298 | LLM calls: 2

Failed-payment workflow: event detection, immediate email, 5-attempt retry ladder (T+0, T+24h, T+72h, T+7d, T+14d), adaptive payment method handling, account suspension rules. Only agent to use 2 LLM calls.

### Agent 13 — Genesis Analyst Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 25.0s | Tokens: ~2,200

All 5 metrics with formulas: Conversion 20%, ARPU $20, ARPPU $100, Churn 40% (flagged critical), MRR $2,000 (cross-checked). 3 quantified recommendations with targets.

### Agent 14 — Genesis Marketing Agent ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: 54.3s | Tokens: >4,000

7-day launch plan with quantitative targets (1,500-5,000 visitors, 20-40 listings/week), tracking stack (GA4, UTMs, Mixpanel), daily actions across GitHub/Twitter/Reddit/Discord/LinkedIn.

### Agent 15 — Genesis SEO Agent ✅

### Agent 16 — Genesis Legal Agent ✅ (slug discrepancy resolved)
Marketplace: `genesis_legal_x402` | Gateway: `legal_agent` | Both: 200 via aliasing

Plain-English ToS risk checklist covering IP ownership, liability limits, payment disputes, agent misconduct, data privacy. Includes "not legal advice" disclaimer.

### Agent 17 — Genesis HR Agent ⚠️ PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL
Marketplace: `genesis_hr_x402` | Gateway: `onboarding_agent` | Both: 200 via aliasing

Both routes work and resolve to the same inner slug (`genesis-hr`).

Complete pipeline architecture: Kafka ingestion → validation/dedup/PII scrubbing → PostgreSQL + S3 + Redis → dbt → Grafana. Full tech stack.

### Agent 19 — Genesis Workflow Automator ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: >60s (consistently slowest)

Trigger/action workflow: signup webhook → SendGrid email → PostgreSQL record → 24h check → Zendesk ticket on failure → retry + dead-letter queue + latency monitoring.

### Agent 20 — Genesis AI Vision API ✅
HTTP: 200 | Time: ~30s

Vision API spec: input formats (JPEG/PNG/WEBP/GIF, 10MB, 4096×4096), response schema with labels/confidence/bounding_box, confidence threshold, 7 error codes, rate limiting with Retry-After.

## Top 5 Immediate Actions

1. **1 line in `main.py` ~1339** — change `bundle_slug == "genesis-meta"` check to apply to all. Unblocks agents 02-05 immediately.
2. **Keep `GENESIS_LLM_MODEL=auto`** in Render env for agents-gateway — activates smart routing.
3. **Update Finance Agent (10) system prompt** — include analytical finance tasks (revenue modeling, unit economics).
4. **HR Agent (17) bundle mapping** — resolved: `onboarding_agent` and `genesis_hr_x402` both map to `genesis-hr`.
5. **Fix quality gate regex** — exclude `{{...}}` template tokens from `proof_validation_failure` heuristic.
